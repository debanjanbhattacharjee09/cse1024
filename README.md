TITLE: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Overview of the project                                                                                                                                                                                                  Library Management System is a project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal of this project is to simulate the operations of a real-world library, including adding books, and viewing books
Features of the Library Management System                                                                                                                                                                            View all books: Display a list of all available books in the library.                                                                                                                                                Add new books: Allow adding new books to the library’s collection.
Technologies/tools used in making this project                                                                                                                                                                          Python:                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The primary programming language for implementing the application's logic and functionalities.                                                                                                          Database Management System (DBMS):                                                                                                                                                                                               SQLite3: A lightweight, serverless, self-contained database often used for smaller projects or embedded applications. It's built directly into Python.                                                                  MySQL/PostgreSQL: More robust, client-server databases suitable for larger-scale applications requiring more advanced features and concurrency.
Steps to install & run the project                                                                                                                                                                                      To install and run a Python-based library management system project, the following steps are generally required:                                                                                                     Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on the system.                                                                                                                                                                 Database: If the project uses a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL), ensure it is installed and configured. For SQLite, it's typically included with Python; for others, separate installation may be needed.
Instructions for testing : Testing a Library Management System (LMS) requires a comprehensive approach to ensure all functionalities work as expected and meet user requirements. The following instructions outline key areas and steps for testing:
1. Understand Requirements and Create Test Plan:
2.Review Requirements: Thoroughly understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the LMS (e.g., adding/deleting books, managing members, search functionality, borrowing/returning, reporting, security, performance).
3.Develop Test Plan: Create a detailed test plan outlining the scope of testing, test objectives, testing types (e.g., functional, integration, performance, security), testing tools, resources, schedule, and defect management process.
