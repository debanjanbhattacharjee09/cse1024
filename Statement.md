PROBLEM STATEMENT : The problem with manual library management systems is that they are inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, leading to issues like lost records, difficulty searching for books, and inaccurate fine collection. A new Library Management System is needed to automate these processes, creating a computerized, efficient, and accurate system for managing books and member transactions. This will improve user experience for both staff and patrons by enabling easy searching, streamlined check-in/check-out, and automated fine calculations.
Scope of the project : 
The scope of a library management system project includes functional aspects like book and user management, circulation (check-in/check-out), search, and reporting, alongside non-functional aspects such as usability, scalability, and security. Key functionalities are automating routine tasks, maintaining an organized catalog, and providing easy access to resources for both librarians and patrons. 
Functional scope
Book Management:
Cataloging new books and other resources.
Tracking inventory and status (e.g., available, on loan).
Managing publishers and lost books.
User Management:
Registering and managing user accounts for patrons, faculty, or staff.
Handling user profiles with details like borrowing history.
Circulation Management:
Automating the process of issuing books to users.
Handling book returns and overdue notifications.
Managing book reservations.
Search and Retrieval:
Providing a robust search function for users to find books by title, author, or category.
Reporting and Analytics:
Generating reports on library usage, popular books, and circulation trends.
Providing reports on members, books, and transactions.
Administration:
Managing staff accounts and permissions.
Monitoring the entire system's activity. 
Non-functional scope
Usability: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both staff and patrons.
Scalability: Designing the system to accommodate a growing collection and user base over time.
Security: Implementing security measures to protect user data and control access.
Reliability: Ensuring the system is stable and can be used efficiently with minimal errors.
Integration: Designing the system to allow for integration with other existing systems, if necessary. 
Potential future scope
Mobile applications: Creating a mobile interface for easier access.
Advanced technologies: Integrating AI or other advanced technologies.
Online notice board: Allowing staff and users to post and view event-related notice
Target users:The target users for a library management system are primarily library staff (librarians, assistants) and end-users (students, faculty, researchers, or community members).
High-level features: This library management system is a combination of the connective interface between python and mysql database .
